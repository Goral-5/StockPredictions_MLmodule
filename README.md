# StockPredictions_MLmodule
## üìú Project Overview
This project is an **interactive stock price prediction tool** using machine learning models:  
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

It fetches stock data, analyzes it, and predicts future stock prices using trained models. The tool also visualizes historical data and predicted prices with interactive candlestick charts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Fetch Real-Time Stock Data:** Uses `yfinance` to retrieve stock data.
- **OHLC Data Display:** Displays Open, High, Low, Close data in a tabular format for the last 7 days.
- **Market Capitalization:** Shows the market cap of the selected stock.
- **Volatility Analysis:** Analyzes the stock's short-term volatility.
- **Price Prediction:** Predicts the stock's price for the next two days using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Interactive Charts:** Plots:
  - Short-term predictions (7 days)
  - Long-term predictions (1 month)
- **Future Predictions Markers:** Displays predicted future prices as markers on the charts.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Data Collection:**  
   Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
   
2. **Model Training:**  
   Trains three models:
   - **Linear Regression:** Finds the best-fit linear relationship between stock features and the target price.
   - **Random Forest:** Uses multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.
   - **XGBoost:** An optimized gradient boosting algorithm for high accuracy.

3. **Prediction:**  
   Predicts future prices based on the trained models.

4. **Visualization:**  
   Plots candlestick charts along with predicted price lines and markers for future prices.
